\usage{
PsiFPOP(
  y,
  beta,
  alpha,
  sampling_method = "rand_one",
  sampling_method_parameter = 1,
  wt = -1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a vector of data ordered according to an attribute}

\item{beta}{a coefficient used in the calculation of the penalty (recommended: 2.5)}

\item{alpha}{a constant used in the calculation of the penalty (recommended: 10+2.5*log(length(y)))}

\item{sampling_method}{a sampling method for candidates ("rand_one", "last", "rand_with_replacement", "rand_without_replacement", "all", "only")}

\item{sampling_method_parameter}{a parameter used by the sampling method}

\item{wt}{a vector of weight linked to the data}
}
\value{
a list with the changepoints and the number of intervals/candidates at each step
}
\description{
PsiFPOP is an extension of Fpop, an exact segmentation algorithm based on functionnal pruning. This extension implements a least squares criterion with a multiscale penalty described in Verzelen et al. 2020.
